/*
 * This is the header for the Single Server, Single Queue system. The heart of this DES simulation.sink
 * Describes the SSSQ class which extends SimObj.
 * SSSQ extends the basic DES engine in SimObj and adds methods for processing,
 * queueing and collecting statistics on entities passed to it from a source, before
 * sending them on to a Sink object for "disposal."
